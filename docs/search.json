    "text": "1 Introduction\nMovies have consistently been integral to a region’s culture. Almost everyone has interacted with this form of media whether through means such as assignments, personal interest, or just plain curiosity. This is one of our motivating reasons in wanting to study movie data. On top of this, growing up surrounded by a variety of cultures, both of us have experienced movies in different languages which led us to view the differences in production across countries. With this, we are interested in studying if there are correlations in languages of movies and the genre they skew towards. We would also like to see if there exists biases in users’ movie ratings (ie. will people who enjoy a certain genre of movie rank that movie higher)",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data we are using primarily are “MovieLens” data. They were collected by GroupLens Research, a research group at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, aimed to provide recommendations of movies for users. The dataset we are using is called MovieLens 32M, which comprises of 32 million ratings and 2 million tags applied to 87,585 movies by 200,948 users. It includes “links.csv,” which assigns each movie an ID, and also lists out each movie’s corresponding ID on IMDb and TMDB (both are movie-rating websites). “movies.csv” comprises of each movie’s title and genres. “ratings.csv” documents each user’s rating of the movies they have seen. “tags.csv” comprises of users’ tags to the movies, expressed in words or short phrases. The dataset was collected in October 2023. We downloaded it directly from GroupLens’ website. In addition, we are going to cross-reference data from TMDB, which we will be getting via its open API. The data on TMDB are updated on an ongoing basis.",
