    "text": "1 Introduction\nDifferent people have distinct preferences for various genres of movies, which affects how they think about a certain movie and their decision to watch it. Therefore, for this project, we aim to explore the patterns of how individuals think of different movies, reflected from the ratings they gave. In addition, we want to examine whether movie ratings could be affected by certain movie features, such as movies’ length. We are also curious to investigate whether different genres of movies evoke different emotional responses.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nPlease note that in this project, we use the term movie loosely. Although we pulled from a movie dataset, many of the rows of data existed as TV shows or Mini Series. We utilize the term movies to encompass the idea of film production due to the nature of the data and for the sake of simplicity.\nThe data we are using primarily are “MovieLens” data. They were collected by GroupLens Research, a research group at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, aimed to provide recommendations of movies for users. The dataset we are using is called MovieLens 32M, which comprises of 32 million ratings and 2 million tags applied to 87,585 titles by 200,948 users. It includes “links.csv,” which assigns each movie an ID, and also lists out each movie’s corresponding ID on IMDb and TMDB (both are movie-rating websites). “movies.csv” comprises of each movie’s title and genres. “ratings.csv” documents each user’s rating of the movies they have seen. “tags.csv” comprises of users’ tags to the movies, expressed in words or short phrases. The dataset was collected in October 2023. We downloaded it directly from GroupLens’ website. In addition, we are going to cross-reference data from IMDB. We utilized the title.basics.tsv dataset located on the IMDB developer website. This dataset helped us get more information on our existing data. This dataset contains the variables tconst which is a unique identifier for the variable (we used this to help join datasets) and titleType which was the format of type of the movie production. There were additional title variables like primaryTitle which was the most popular title and original title which was the original title of the movie. There was also distinguishing characteristics of adult titles and non-adult titles as well as the starting year and ending year for releases. Finally, a column called runtimeMinutes tracks the runtime of the production.",

From the boxplot, we can tell that there is a difference in the distribution of average ratings between these two groups, demonstrating that genres watched more often tend to receive higher ratings in general compared to those watched less often.",

From the graph above, we observe that overall, genres that received a positive sentiment include: Animation, Children, Fantasy (slightly positive), Romance (slightly positive), and Musical. Genres that received a negative sentiment include: Action, Crime, Drama (slightly negative), Film-Noir, Horror, Mystery, Thriller, War, and Western. Genres that received a neutral sentiment are: Adventure, Comedy, Documentary, and Sci-Fi.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In conclusion, we observed several distinct patterns in how people perceive movies. Overall, most people tend to give relatively positive ratings. Ratings given to different genres are mostly similar, regardless of whether movies evoke more positive or negative emotions. However, people do tend to rate genres higher if they watch them more frequently. Additionally, we have observed positive correlations for certain genre selections as well as negative correlations for others. For example, selection of Adventure and Action as well as Animation and Children have positive correlations; selection of Romance and Action as well as Adventure and Drama have negative correlations. However, one limitation of our project is related to sentiment analysis. The tags people assigned movies might not always accurately reflect their emotional sentiments, and the package “syuzhet” may not capture the full scope of sentiment nuances. Going forward, we would be interested in finding datasets specifically focused on sentiment-related questions, which can provide more insights.",
