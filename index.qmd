# Introduction

Movies have consistently been integral to a region's culture. Almost everyone has interacted with this form of media whether through means such as assignments, personal interest, or just plain curiosity. This is one of our motivating reasons in wanting to study movie data. On top of this, growing up surrounded by a variety of cultures, both of us have experienced movies in different languages which led us to view the differences in production across countries. With this, we are interested in studying if there are correlations in languages of movies and the genre they skew towards. We would also like to see if there exists biases in users' movie ratings (ie. will people who enjoy a certain genre of movie rank that movie higher)
