# Introduction

Different people have distinct preferences for various genres of movies, which affects how they think about a certain movie and their decision to watch it. Therefore, for this project, we aim to explore the patterns of how individuals think of different movies, reflected from the ratings they gave. In addition, we want to examine whether movie ratings could be affected by certain movie features, such as moviesâ€™ length. We are also curious to investigate whether different genres of movies evoke different emotional responses.
