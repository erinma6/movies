They were collected by GroupLens Research, a research group at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, aimed to provide recommendations of movies for users. The dataset we are using is called MovieLens 32M, which comprises of 32 million ratings and 2 million tags applied to 87,585 movies by 200,948 users. It includes “links.csv,” which assigns each movie an ID, and also lists out each movie's corresponding ID on IMDb and TMDB (both are movie-rating websites). “movies.csv” comprises of each movie’s title and genres.  “ratings.csv” documents each user’s rating of the movies they have seen. “tags.csv” comprises of users' tags to the movies, expressed in words or short phrases. The dataset was collected in October 2023. We downloaded it directly from GroupLens' website. In addition, we are going to cross-reference data from TMDB, which we will be getting via its open API. The data on TMDB are updated on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Missing value analysis\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Change this as needed\nvariable <- '/Users/melodyma/Downloads/ml-32m'\n\nmovies <- read.csv(file.path(variable, 'movies.csv'))\nratings <- read.csv(file.path(variable, 'ratings.csv'))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresult <- merge(movies, ratings, by = \"movieId\", all = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    movieId          title              genres              userId      \n Min.   :     1   Length:32003357    Length:32003357    Min.   :     1  \n 1st Qu.:  1233   Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.: 50053  \n Median :  3452   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :100297  \n Mean   : 29332                                         Mean   :100279  \n 3rd Qu.: 44199                                         3rd Qu.:150451  \n Max.   :292757                                         Max.   :200948  \n                                                        NA's   :3153    \n     rating       timestamp        \n Min.   :0.50   Min.   :7.897e+08  \n 1st Qu.:3.00   1st Qu.:1.051e+09  \n Median :3.50   Median :1.273e+09  \n Mean   :3.54   Mean   :1.275e+09  \n 3rd Qu.:4.00   3rd Qu.:1.503e+09  \n Max.   :5.00   Max.   :1.697e+09  \n NA's   :3153   NA's   :3153       \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nna_counts <- colSums(is.na(result))\n\nna_df <- data.frame(\n  Column = names(na_counts),\n  NA_Count = na_counts\n)\n\nggplot(na_df, aes(x = Column, y = NA_Count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of NA Values by Column\",\n    x = \"Column\",\n    y = \"NA Count\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAfter merging the dataset movies with the dataset ratings, the graph and summary plot show us that there are around 3000 NA values in rating, timestamp, and userId.
